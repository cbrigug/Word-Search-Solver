## Word Search Solver
* Allows the user to either capture or upload a previously-existing photo before autonomously extracting the text to form a word search/list
* Application processes images using an OCR library before running text through a series of algorithms which reveal the solution

## Demo:
1. Upload or capture a picture of the word search
2. Do the same for the word list (or manually type)
3. Ensure the OCR is correct/make adjustments if not
4. Solve!
